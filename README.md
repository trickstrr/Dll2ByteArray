# DLL to C ByteArray Converter

This tool converts a DLL file into a C-compatible byte array and saves it as a header file. 
I also included (commented out since i didnt needed it) some header definitions to make sure it is compatible in your C++ code.

## Features

- Converts any DLL (or binary file) to a C-compatible byte array
- Outputs the array to a header file (`um.h`)
- Includes array size information in the declaration
- Compatible with both C and C++ projects

## Usage

1. Compile the program
2. Drag the Dll File into the Dll2ByteArray.exe
3. output is on the same location as the .exe
